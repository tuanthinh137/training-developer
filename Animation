Animation
CSS Animation Rules
Avoid applying a transition to all attributes
You should keep applying a transition to matching attributes to increase website performance.

.selector {
  background: var(--white);
  transition: background 0.3s ease; /* don't use `transition: all` */

  &:hover {
    background: var(--primary);
  }
}
Animation attributes
The animation is not working well with some attributes:

margin
padding
height: auto;
Using translate3d
Using tranlate3d is better than translateX or translateY to keep a GPU render.

.selector {
  transform: translate3d(0, -50%, 0);
  transition: transform .3s ease;

  &:hover {
    transition: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
  }
}
