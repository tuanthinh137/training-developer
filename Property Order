Property Order
CSS Property Order
Why order the declarations in a CSS rule at all? The goal is to understand the essence of the styles by reading a few declarations. Most of the time, the essence is how the element is laid out and its size is determined. Proper ordering of rules allows us to "scan" the declaration block for properties quickly.
